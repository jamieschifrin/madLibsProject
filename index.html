<P>I just got back from a pizza party with PERSON. Can you believe we got to eat ADJECTIVE pizza in PLACE?! Everyone got to choose their own toppings. I made 'FOOD and THINGS' pizza, which is my favorite! They even stuffed the crust with THINGS. How FEELINGS! If that wasn't good enough already, CELEBRITY was there singing SONG TITLE. I was so inspired by the music, I had to get up out of my seat and VERB.</P>
